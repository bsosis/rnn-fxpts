direct test single c hypothesis
    combo to get all components
    keep repeating until a c is found with single component (timeouts are inconclusive, but no timeouts would be good)
    repeat that on a bunch of networks, then a bunch of Ns
    this needs more work.  Need a watertight way to be confident all components have been found
combo_trial should group all outputs by traversal, not by individual iterate
better term ratio: use time elapsed between last and second-to-last fixed point found
make optional to refine in ge.process_point?

look for the "eigenvectors" of the dynamics: vectors v where f(v) = \lambda * v.  Fixed points are a special case.

fantasies:
c at these eigenvectors are fully connected
the sets of these eigenvectors have some duality principle to the directional fibers used in some sort of linear/semidefinite programming -like optimization

things to plot:
    example absolute for local, fiber, combo over time
    average % of union for local, fiber, and combo over time
    average "time to hit union" for local, fiber, combo (make sure second half of time, nothing new found)
    example histogram # of disconnected components for single N
    average+stdev # of disconnected components over different N
    example histogram # of points per disconnected component
    average # of points per disconnected component over N

shows that sign change will not necessarily happen at local alpha min when discrete steps
better with both checks: sign change OR local alpha min
ideally, be able to prove at most one fixed point will be passed during a step
even more so, that region of convergence to any fixed point with NR fiber steps wont be overstepped
Preliminary idea: Test empirically if alpha dot = 0 always occurs at a hump for at least one i
humps: W_i v = k, where tanh'(k) = W_ii/|W_i|^2.


3d fxpt:
    Grid sampling of each W_ij in [-A,A] with A > 1.  So r^9 where r is the sampling rate.
    "Continuous" path through each resulting W sample.
    At each W, grid sampling of c (~ r^2).
    At each (W,c), track # of connected components in fiber, and length/steps/runtime/most "singular" point.
    For each W, identify optimal c (best [runtime] of all c with fully connected fiber)
    Visualization where W changes "continuously" through the samples, at each one plotting W rows, columns, eigs, svds, etc, along with optimal c.
    Looking for coincidence of c with some W feature ideally, or if not coincidence, correlation in the movement.
    Can permutations of W rows or columns be omitted from the grid search wolog?

make fxpt_experiments more consolidated and consistent
    filename prefixes/suffixes for different experiments
    encapsulate duplicated code
