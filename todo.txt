really need a provable that alpha sign will not flip for theta in [0, theta^*]?
    based on a belief that in the problem cases, that first step is jumping right over.
    verify this belief on a problem case by reducing max_step_size until it isn't overstepped.
combo_trial should group all outputs by traversal, not by individual iterate
better term ratio: use time elapsed between last and second-to-last fixed point found
make optional to refine in ge.process_point?

things to plot:
    example absolute for local, fiber, combo over time
    average % of union for local, fiber, and combo over time
    average "time to hit union" for local, fiber, combo (make sure second half of time, nothing new found)
    example histogram # of disconnected components for single N
    average+stdev # of disconnected components over different N
    example histogram # of points per disconnected component
    average # of points per disconnected component over N
    everything 3d fxpt

3d fxpt:
    Grid sampling of each W_ij in [-A,A] with A > 1.  So r^9 where r is the sampling rate.
    "Continuous" path through each resulting W sample.
    At each W, grid sampling of c (~ r^2).
    At each (W,c), track # of connected components in fiber, and length/steps/runtime/most "singular" point.
    For each W, identify optimal c (best [runtime] of all c with fully connected fiber)
    Visualization where W changes "continuously" through the samples, at each one plotting W rows, columns, eigs, svds, etc, along with optimal c.
    Looking for coincidence of c with some W feature ideally, or if not coincidence, correlation in the movement.
    Can permutations of W rows or columns be omitted from the grid search wolog?

make fxpt_experiments more consolidated and consistent
    filename prefixes/suffixes for different experiments
    encapsulate duplicated code
