rerun all full_base stability (again!) with max_eigs
consistent figure sizes (at least widths)
as consistent as possible in log vs normal axis scaling while still legible
make fxpt_experiments more consolidated and consistent
    filename prefixes/suffixes for different experiments
    encapsulate duplicated code
